"""Game start / end for the Stratos analytics (rule: C:\\Users\\saiqu\\GAME_ANALYTICS_RULE.md).

track("level_start", ...) starts the clock; "level_complete" / "game_over" also carry
`seconds` = how long that game lasted. Events go only to the shared Stratos script on
the stratos.games play page (window.Stratos). Anywhere else (GitHub Pages, APK,
desktop) there is no window.Stratos, so nothing is sent and nothing can break.
